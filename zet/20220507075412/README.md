# My first zettel, what a zet should look like

I hope to follow the zettelkasten way of retaining knowledge using github for knmowledge collection and markdown for note taking.

So I will note down the guide to make a zet.

* it should use an isosec for name - isosec (yearMonthDayHourMinuteSecond)
* it should have a heading (not more that 50 unicode characters)
* not more than 25 lines for the body
* it should include a reference after the body
* it should contain hashtags for easy searches later
* stick with single level list
* no sub headings
