# So what is devops?
Devops is a mind set that the whole company adopts; not a seperate team or a subset of the ops or dev team.

It's the recognition that working in silos dont work. Creating another team is simply seperating devs and ops further. It's not something one team does, it's a cultural transformation on an organisational scale; it's development and operations engineer working together through out the development lifecycle using lean and agile principles allowing them deliver high quality results.

## Every one is responsible for success
- Functional silos breed bad behaviour; problems arise when you abstract people away from consequence of their actions.

- Make people aware of the consequence of their actions

- Make people responsible for the consequence of their actions

**Devops organizational objective: Shared Consciousness with distributed(local) control**
--- this encourages people to do their best work.
