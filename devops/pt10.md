# Infrastructure as code

This is the practice of describing infrastructure in textual format; that is executable, configuring Infrastructure with code.

**Importance**

- Server Drift a major source of failure.
- Servers are not cattle not pets; quickly replacable not to watse time on down servers.
- Infra is transcient; you bring it up when you need it and tak it down when it's not in use.
- Build through parallel infrastructure.

*Infrastructure as code enable you build identical infrastructure all the time.*

## Immutable delivery via containers
 Tools such as Docker help build Immutable Delivery:
 - Applications are packaged in container
 - Same container can run in production and locally
 - No variance
 - Rolling update and immediate roll back
 

## Immutable way of working
- You never make changes to a running container
- You make changes to the image
- Then you redeploy a new container
- Images are to be kept up to date, they are the templates
