# Work in small batches
1. Faster feedback
2. It supports experimentation
3. Minimize waste because [1]
4. Deliver usable stuff early

## How to measure the size of a batch

- *Feature size* supports frequent releases
- Should be completed in a sprint
- Should be steps towards a goal, so keep them small

## Enter MVP
MVP(Minimum Viable Product) *is not* the phase 1 of a project but rather the cheapest thing you can do to prove hypothesis, it is focused on learning and not delivery. 
It is working iteratively with the user/customer.

**It mostly about gaining knowledge and understanding what we are building**
