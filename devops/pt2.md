# On Social Coding Principles

With social codin, repositpries are piblic, everyoone is encouraged to fork the code and contribute. Although the owner is still in control of what contributons are accepted.

## Pair Programming
Derived from **Xtreme** programming. Two programmers, one system battling same problem. one programmer acts as the *Driver* and the other acts as the *navigator*.

## Benefits of Pair Programming
- Higher code quality
- Defects are found earlier
- Skill transfer
- Low maintenance cost
- Broad understanding of the code base.

## Git Repo Guideline

Git flow supports social coding
- Create a seperate git repo for every component
- Craete a new branch for every issue (Master branch and feature branches)
- Never merge your own pull request, every pull request is an oportunity for code review.
