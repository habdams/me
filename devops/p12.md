# Continous Delivery

**CD requires CI**

- The master branch should always be deployable
- You need a way to know if something will *break the build*
- Deliver every change to a production like environment

## CI/CD Pipeline needs
- A code repository
- A build server
- An integration serve
- An artifact repository
- A  tool for automatic configuration and deployment

CI/CD ontop of software development life cycle

| CI | CD |
| --- | --- |
| Plan > Code > Build > Test > | Release > Deploy > Operate |

## 5 key principles of CI/CD
- Build quality in
- Work in small batches
- Computer perform repetitive task, people solve problems
- Relentlessly pursue continous improvement
- Everyone is responsible

## Continous Deployment
It is reserved for deploying to production; When we use automation to handle deployment to production.

## In a nutshell

### CI
- Code repo and Version COntrol: Developer pushes code and automatically triggers server build.
- Build Integration and Automation: CI server starts the build and run test.

### CD
- Release Automation: Store any artifactory outcome from the build.
- Delivery Automation: Deploy binaries to any given environment.

### Continous Deployment
- Production Automation: Promote deployment to production(on prem, public cloud, hybrid cloud)

## How deveops manage risk
- Deployment is king
- Deployment is decoupled from activation; using feature flags to activate or deactivate a feature in production without having a redeploy.
- Deployment is not a one size fits all
