# Working Devops
These make a working devops: 

- Culure of Teams, chnage the way people work (Teaming and interaction)
- Agile development as a shared discipline
- Automate relentlessly in other to respond rapidly.
- Push small releases early; gain feedback early, minimize risk and maximize learning.

## Taylorism
 This is how taylorism work:
- Command and control management
- Organizations divided into functional silos
- Decision making is differnt from work
 
 > - *hand offs*
PMs > Archs > Dev > Tester > Ops > Customers

Taylorism doesn't work in software development.

-- Software engineer is very different from civil engineering

1. software engineeer is organic; constantly updated

1. new features are being added

1. system behaviour changes everytime

***The Project Model Is Flawed***


Project manaement doesn't work for software development, we should treat software development like product development. This will encourage ownership and understanding building at the same time a maintanable, stable and lasting teams.
