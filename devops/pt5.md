# Enter BDD
BDD (Behaviour Driven Development)
BDD forces you to think from the outside(the customers perspective) considering behaviours that affect business outcomes. BDD is great for integration tests.

### BDD & TDD
*BDD* ensures you are building the right thing while *TDD* endures you are building the thing right.

## BDD Workflow
Workflow starts with devs, customers and testers exploting problem domain and collaborating to produce concrete examples/ scenerios that describe the behaviour they want.

Behaviour is documented using a language known as **Gherkin(a natural language representation)**

## Gherkin Syntax
- Given (some context)
-- When (some event happen)
--- Then (some testable action)
---- And (more context, chain)

**USe Gherkin for Acceptance Criteria**
context: 

---- User Story ----
** Add Acceptance criteria to every user story

**BDD improves communication, as everyone knows what to expect**
