# Continous Integration
The process of continously building, testing and integrating every developer update int the master branch after a set of test have passed; the result is potencially **Deployable Code**.

CD is series of practices designed to ensure that code can be rapidly and safely deployed to production by deliverying every change to a *Production-like* environment; it doesnt like to have to be deployed to production.

## CI
- Developers integrate code often
- Devs work in short lived feature branches
- Every check-in is verified by automated

Once merged branch is deleted.

## Changes are kept small

- Working in small batches
- Commit regularly
- Using Pull requests
- Committing changes daily

## CI automation
- Build and test every pull request
- Use CI tools that monitor version control
- Test should runt after every build; make the build slef tested
- Never merge a pulll request failing test; the test result should feedback to the pull request

## BEnefits of CI
- Faster reaction time
- Reduce code integration
- Higher code quality.
- The code in version control should work; the master branch is always deployable.

*Always assume untested code never works*
