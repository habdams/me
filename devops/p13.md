# Organizational Impact of Devops
Organization must have these to implement devops: 
- Become agile
- Small teams
- Dedicated teams
- Cross functional teams
- Self organized(one sprint at a time)


## Conway's Law
- Any organization that designs a system(defned broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of it's organization's communication structure.

**It's better to organize teams around business domains**

- Each team has it own mission aligned with the business; they should feel like a small startup in their self.
- The teams should have a long term mission usually around a single business domain.
- They have end to end responsibilty for what they build.
