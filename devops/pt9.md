# Required Devops Behaviors
    There's a clash of work cultures between Devops and Traditional Ops: Because Enterprise see **New** as complex and time-consuming, they will rather build once on calculated overheads but Devops embrace breaking large processes into smaller bits and do a continual series of small chnages. NOw the conflict is the  Devops way of doing things cannot survive tradition overheads.

## A Clash of Cultures

| Traditional | Devops |
| ------------ | ------|
| Manual Cofiguration changes to critical infrastructure | Automated deployment to all environment
| Application architecture defined by network design | Network design defined by application architectures
| Bespoke infrastructure built once, then maintained | Ephemeral infrastructure created for each new deployment
| Risk managed thriugh change window | Risk managed through progressive activation
| Process biased toward "build once" | Builds are repeatable leveraging infrastructure as code |


**Devlopment wants innovation; to keep up with changing demands and needs of the customer while Operation wants stability** - *This is the wall of confusion between devs and ops*

** Silos breed apathy
