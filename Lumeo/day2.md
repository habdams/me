_Worklog_

Implemented ticket: add delayed tooltip to unlabeled icons.
It helped me get my foot wet in contributing code to the console application designed, developed and maintained by PAtricia. It took sometime and her help to navigate to the right components and actual implementation.

It's a fairly simple task which was why I couldn't imagine struggling with it. I took time to tweak until I found result. **One key lesson today is most of the time the solution or the path to solution is in the INSTRUCTION** as I found my self getting clearer and clearer understanding of what was expected of me each time I go back to the comments Patricia left on the PR I raised.

I am hopeful to get up to speed soon and grateful for Patricia. She has been helpful and ***patient** with me. Although it's the first day. <br>
